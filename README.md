Job polarization and routinization: Evidence for Turkey" coauthored by Evren Gulser and Ensar Yilmaz. The abstract of the paper is available below:

## Abstract            
In this paper, we investigate polarization dynamics in the labor market in Turkiye. For this, we first use highly refined microdata sets to classify task measures (mainly abstract, routine, and manual) that allow us to make the occupation-task level analysis. Secondly, we find support for polarization led by technological changes (routinization hypothesis), education, and increasing female employment in the low- and high-wage spectrum of occupations. Finally, we analyze the tasks performed by workers in their respective occupations. It suggests that the occupational assignment of tasks determines the value of tasks, implying that a structural context of tasks exists.

**Note:** Due to strict requirements imposed by TurkStat regarding the accessibility of original microdata, the data file in this repository does not include the original data.
