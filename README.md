Job polarization and routinization: Evidence for Turkey" coauthored by Evren Gulser and Ensar Yilmaz. The abstract of the paper is available below:

## Abstract            
In this paper we investigate polarization dynamics in the labor market in Turkey.
For this, we firstly use highly refined micro data sets to classify task measures (mainly
abstract, routine and manual) that allows us to make the occupation-task level analysis
rather than using sector-level data level, which allows us to analyze the polarization in job
market in Turkey. Secondly, using task measures (mainly abstract, routine and manual) to
classify jobs, we find support for polarization led by technological changes (routinization
hypothesis), education and increasing female employment at low- and high-waged spectrum
of occupations. Lastly, we analyze the tasks performed by workers within their respective
jobs, which can be explained by factors such as their individual human capital, demographic
characteristics, and the technical requirements intrinsic to the job itself. Even though there
are discernible variations in job tasks, which persist within specific occupations, it is still
important that the occupational assignment of tasks determines value of tasks, implying
that there exists a structural context of tasks.
